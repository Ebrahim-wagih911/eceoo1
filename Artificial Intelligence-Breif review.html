In artificial intelligence, Margaret Hyde explains from a target point of view from a third-person perspective that older computers - data processors that receive, store and display information - develop into artificial brains that can learn, infer and form conclusions. While scientists are working on creating "fifth generation" computers, they know how complex the brain-driven activities are in humans. Through a network of billions of neurons, the brain provides the human powers that scientists find surprisingly complex when they try to replicate them in the sequence and parallel needed to program computer. The human mind can store a lot of information and then create relationships between different parts of information in order to reach conclusions appropriate to the constantly changing circumstances. Computer scientists face the challenge of creating an AI that is adaptable to this contrast. The first three chapters of the book define the human brain as a pattern for advanced computers.
